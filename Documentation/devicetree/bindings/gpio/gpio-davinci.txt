Davinci GPIO controller bindings

Required Properties:
- compatible:"ti,davinci-gpio"

- reg: Physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
	region.

- interrupts: The Starting IRQ number for GPIO

- ngpio: The number of GPIO pins supported

- intc_irq_num: The number of IRQs supported by the Interrupt Controller

- gpio_unbanked: The number of GPIOs that have an individual interrupt
		line to processor.

Example:
gpio: gpio@1e26000 {
	compatible = "ti,davinci-gpio";
	reg = <0x226000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <42>;
	ngpio = <144>;
	intc_irq_num = <101>;
	gpio_unbanked = <0>;
};
